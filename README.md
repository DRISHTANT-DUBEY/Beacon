<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great flutter templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a Flutter App so basic that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem of api construction and login for user auth. 
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating the logic from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one app will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.


### Built With
This section lists the major frameworks that we built for using project.
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)
* [Python](https://www.python.org)
